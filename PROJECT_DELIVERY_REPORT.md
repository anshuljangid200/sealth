**Client:** Sealth Team  
**Developer:** Anshul Jangid  
**Timeline:** 2 Weeks (January 2026)  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready & Deployed

---

## 📋 Executive Summary
Over the past two weeks, we have successfully developed and deployed a comprehensive, secure, and scalable health-tech platform. The application features a robust role-based architecture supporting six distinct user types, fully integrated with MongoDB for data persistence and Google Sheets for real-time activity monitoring. The platform is now live and adheres to professional production security standards.

## 🛠️ Key Milestones & Features Delivered

### Week 1: Foundation & UI/UX Development
*   **Role-Based Architecture**: Developed six specialized dashboards (Customer, Doctor, Admin, Coach, Kitchen, and Delivery).
*   **Premium UI Design**: Implemented a modern design system featuring glassmorphism effects, smooth micro-animations, and a high-end aesthetic.
*   **100% Responsive Design**: Finalized layouts that are fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop devices.
*   **Core Modules**: Built the Doctor Discovery System, Health Metrics Tracker, and an interactive Expert Messaging interface.

### Week 2: Backend, Security & Deployment
*   **Advanced Authentication**: 
    *   Implemented industry-standard password hashing using `bcryptjs`.
    *   Setup a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authorization system for protected routes.
    *   Integrated Google OAuth for secure, one-tap social login.
*   **Database & External Integrations**: 
    *   Connected the application to MongoDB Atlas (Cloud) for real-time data management.
    *   Developed Mongoose schemas for User profiles, health logs, and appointment records.
    *   Automated user activity logging via Google Apps Script to a dedicated Google Sheet.
*   **Production Deployment**:
    *   Deployed the full-stack application on Vercel using Serverless Functions for the backend.
    *   Configured security headers (COOP) and environment variables for a stable production environment.

## 🔒 Security Implementation
1.  **Data Protection**: All user passwords are encrypted; plain text passwords are never stored in the database.
2.  **Elimination of Vulnerabilities**: Removed all developer backdoors and mock credential fallbacks to ensure only authorized users can log in.
3.  **Cross-Origin Safety**: Implemented site-wide security headers to prevent unauthorized access and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
4.  **Network Security**: Configured MongoDB whitelistings to allow secure database access from Vercel's global IP range.

## 🚀 Technical Stack
*   **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (Operating as Serverless Functions on Vercel).
*   **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Logging/Monitoring**: Google Apps Script & Google Sheets.
*   **Platform**: Vercel.
